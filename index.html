    <h2 class="text">Hi! I'm Suryo!</h2>
        <p>I am a student at the <b>University of Texas at Arlington</b>, pursuing a master's degree in <b>Computer Science and Engineering</b>. I am working on my MS thesis under the guidance of <b>Dr. Manfred Huber</b> on feature learning and preemptive estimation of performance for KNN classifiers and regressors. I'm also working on implementing neural networks on FPGAs with <b>Dr. Amir Farbin</b>.</br></br>

Prior to joining UTA, I was first an undergraduate student, and then a <b>Research Associate</b> at PESIT Bangalore South Campus (then affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University, now PES University) where I worked with <b>Dr. Snehanshu Saha</b> on a broad range of topics in machine learning and it's applications to astronomy, finance and scientometrics. I am set to begin pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at <b>Pennsylvania State University</b> from Fall 2020 under the guidance of <b>Dr. Mahanth Gowda</b>.</br></br>

My research interests are broadly in the areas of <b>machine learning</b> and <b>intelligent systems.</b> I am proficient in <b>C</b>, <b>C++</b>, and <b>Python</b>, and have a good amount of knowledge about a lot of other languages and programming tools such as <b>Verilog</b>, <b>SQL</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>MATLAB</b>, <b>Arduino</b>, <b>Raspberry Pi</b>, <b>Beagle Bone</b>, <b>Processing Language</b>, <b>LaTeX</b>, <b>Javascript</b>, <b>HTML/CSS</b>, <b>Tensorflow</b>, <b>numpy</b>, <b>scikit-learn</b>, etc., and even some <b>electronics</b> but I use them on the basis of my needs in my current projects or work. I love the philosophy of <b>open source</b> and have contributed to <b>ensmallen</b>, a fast and flexible mathematical optimization library, written in C++.</br></br>

On a less academic note, I am a musician and enjoy playing the guitar! I also try to paint and do different kinds of artsy stuff from time to time.

		</li></br>

		<li><b>Peer Educator</b>, <em>IDEAS Center, UTA Faculty Affairs</em> (August 2019 – December 2019): I tutored and mentored undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics, computer science, English and basic sciences, and mentored students with goal setting, time management, major exploration, etc. I was a designated tutor of an undergraduate course on <em>linear algebra and differential equations</em> (MATH-3319) under Dr. Gaik Ambartsoumian. I was also certified in the practice of question, pursuade and refer(QPR) for suicide prevention, and trained to accommodatethe needs of students from a wide spectrum of socioeconomic and sociocultural backgrounds.
		</li></br>

		<li><b>Research Associate</b>, <em>Department of Computer Science and Engineering, PESIT Bangalore South Campus</em> (July 2017 – July 2018): I worked on problems in astroinformatics, and mathematical modeling in finance with Dr. Snehanshu Saha, and collaborated with Dr. Jayant Murthy and Dr. Margarita Safonova from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, and Dr. Saibal Kar from the Center For Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta. I also mentored senior undergraduate students with curriculum-related presentation.

		<li><b>Tau Beta Pi Member</b> <em>(2019)</em>: Elected to Tau Beta Pi (TBΠ; Texas Eta Chapter), the oldest national engineering honor societyin USA, based on distinguished scholarship and exemplary character. Elected students are in top 20% of their class.</li></br>

		<li><b>Lone Star Non-Resident Tuition Waiver Scholarship</b> <em>(2018)</em>: Awarded by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, eligible for in-state tuition rates (for Fall 2018 – Summer 2019).</li></br>

		<li><b>Best Outgoing Student Award</b> <em>(2017)</em>: Awarded by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, PESIT Bangalore South Campus for overall excellence and service to the institute (I'm not sure why they didn't call this award the 'Best Graduating Student Award' because that's what it is; a good friend of mine raised the concern that the title of this award may lead one to believe that I got the award for being 'outgoing' – just to be clear, no, I did not win an award for being outgoing).</li></br>

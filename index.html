	<h2 class="text">Hi! I'm Suryoday!</h1>
	<p align='center'>I am a student at the University of Texas at Arlington, pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Prior to this, I was a Research Associate at PESIT Bangalore South Campus.</p>
	<p align='center'>I'm a Project Research Assoicate of "An Interdisciplinary Study in Machine Learning and Classification
		for Astronomy", SERB-DST: Funded project grant of Forty lacs (INR) approximately,
		over three years. File#: EMR/2016/005687</p>
	<p align='center'>I completed my Bachelor's in Engineering in Computer Science (in August 2017). I aspire to pursue research in Astroinformatics and Machine Learning.</p>
	<p align='center'>I am currently working on splitting criteria for decision tree classifiers, ML-based exoplanetary habitability metrics, and statistical modeling of GALEX (Galaxy Explorer Satellite) data.</p>

<div class="container">
	<h2 class="text">A Confession For Anyone Who Lands Here.</h1>
	<p align='center'> You have landed here at an interesting time.
	
	I know for a fact that all statements of purpose, curriculum vitaes and documents for application to Ph.D. programs need to be of a professional nature. But as long as you are here, I will give myself some slack and be a little
unprofessional. </br>

I know that I haven't studied in the best of places for my undergraduate degree. I know that I could have been better all along. But I did the best and everything that I have experienced contributes to my knowledge and my perspectives of the world. </br>

You see, in India, all of the half-decent engineering colleges have really serious on-campus placements. I got an on-campus job at MuSigma. That was the one and only on-campus job placement that I had taken a shot at. I got the job and I never
looked back. About 10 months down the line, MuSigma called me to ask if I wanted to join them, but I put their offer down. </br>

MuSigma is an amazing company. But my dreams were bigger than me. I gave up a high paying job for about $150 a month - to pursue research in PESIT Bangalore South Campus. Heck, I earn that much tutoring for 14 hours a week, for 10 days. But evidently, I had to give up a lot more so that I could follow my dreams. </br>

But that's what I did. I worked with Dr. Snehanshu Saha, my academic mentor (and his opinions will matter the most to me for many many years to come). I settled for a really low-paying job so that I could do what I love - work on 
problems in research. Yes. One full year. Twelve full months. 365+ days. </br>

And you might stop to wonder - why did I mention the <it>'+'</it>? That's because once I decide something is important in my life, I pursue it relentlessly. Dr. Saha and I set up the Astroinformatics Research Group. What started as a set
of scribbles on a whiteboard, over arguments of what we should name ourselves. We finally decided to call ourselves AstrIRG. </br>
y
 We are now recognized by some of the leaders in astroinformatics. In particular, PennState's ASAIP recognizes our efforts <a>https://asaip.psu.edu/resources/research-group-links</a>. Dr. Saha is now on the advisory of the International Astrostatistics Association. </br>

So by now, you're wondering - "this is all over the place." But yes, we're aiding in the discovery of important aspects of our word. Machine Learning in Astronomy is simply beautoful. </br>

By the way - what are you doing with your life? </br>

Recruit me - and I will be the best recruit that you'll ever have. Ultimately, to me, computataion has got to do more with humans and society, than with machines.
